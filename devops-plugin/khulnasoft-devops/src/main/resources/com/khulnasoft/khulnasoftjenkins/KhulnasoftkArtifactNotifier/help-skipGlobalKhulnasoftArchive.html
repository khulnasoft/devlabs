<div>
  <p>
    When enabled, this job will skip the global Khulnasoft archiving behavior configured at the system level.
    This is useful when you want this specific job to handle artifact archiving differently or not at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Use cases:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jobs that should not send artifacts to Khulnasoft</li>
    <li>Jobs that handle artifact archiving through custom scripts or other means</li>
    <li>Jobs in development or testing phases where Khulnasoft integration is not needed</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This setting only affects the automatic archiving behavior.
    You can still manually trigger artifact archiving using the RunDelegate.archive() method in your build scripts.
  </p>
